Tax integration means the combined corporate + personal tax on dividends is designed to roughly equal the tax on salary, but differences exist. This calculator helps you model both strategies over multiple years."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Tax integration is the principle that income should be taxed similarly whether earned personally or through a corporation. When you pay corporate tax and then personal tax on dividends, the dividend gross-up and tax credit system is designed so the total tax approximates what you'd pay on salary. However, integration is imperfect and varies by province."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "RDTOH (Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand) is a mechanism where some corporate tax on investment income is refunded when you pay dividends. The corporation pays ~50% tax on passive income, but 30.67% is added to the RDTOH account and refunded at $38.33 per $100 of taxable dividends paid. This reduces the effective tax on corporate investments."

            "text": "When a CCPC earns more than $50,000 in passive investment income, the Small Business Deduction (SBD) limit is reduced by $5 for every $1 over $50,000. At $150,000 of passive income, the SBD is fully eliminated. This means more active business income gets taxed at the higher general rate (~26%) instead of the small business rate (~12%)."
